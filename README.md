# About TGAA stats

This project was started to practice my newly found React skills.

The aim was a one-page website that uses the [Steam Web API](https://steamcommunity.com/dev) to display the percentage of players who successfully made each achievement in my favourite game, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles.

## Skills used:

- Javascript
- React
- CSS
- API calls

## How to see it in action

### Live preview

You can see the site live at [tgaa-stats.netlify.app](https://tgaa-stats.netlify.app/)

### Local development

The site was created using create-react-app, and will work with all of the usual npm commands associated with this should you wish to download the code to your machine:
`npm start` will start a local development server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Alternate version

I also created a React Native version of this app for mobile devices. You can see the code at [github.com/CeriW/tgaa-stats-app](https://github.com/CeriW/tgaa-stats-app)
